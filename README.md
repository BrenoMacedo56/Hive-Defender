# Hive Defender üêù  
### An Intelligent System for Detecting Threats in Beehives

## Introduction
*Hive Defender* is a project developed during the second half of 2024 as part of the ENTEC technology event, held by the University of Uberaba (Uniube). The main goal of the project is to monitor, in real-time, the health and integrity of bees within a specific beehive, utilizing advanced techniques in computer vision and artificial intelligence.

Bees play a crucial role in pollination and maintaining the balance of ecosystems; however, they are increasingly threatened by external factors, such as the *Varroa destructor* mite. This parasitic mite poses one of the greatest dangers to the survival of bee colonies, potentially wiping out entire hives. *Hive Defender* was created to combat this threat and aims to expand the detection of other threats that compromise bee health in the future.

## Project Structure
The project employs a **YOLOv8** object detection model, which was trained on a dataset consisting of approximately 500 to 600 images. These images capture the presence of *Varroa destructor* within beehives. Through automatic visual analysis, the model identifies the presence of the mite in real-time, issuing alerts for early intervention.

The choice of YOLOv8 was based on its balance between accuracy and speed, both of which are essential for real-time monitoring. The model is integrated into a pipeline that processes images captured directly from the beehives, detecting any anomalies that may represent a threat to the well-being of the bees.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
*This section will be detailed later, explaining the complete workflow from image capture to threat detection.*

## Possible Adjustments and Improvements
Although *Hive Defender* already demonstrates good results in detecting *Varroa destructor*, there is always room for improvements and optimizations that can enhance the system's efficiency. Some suggestions include:

1. **Dataset Expansion:** Significantly increase the number of images in the training dataset. Additionally, incorporate greater diversity in the images, capturing different lighting conditions, angles, and contexts, which will allow the model to be more robust and adaptable.

2. **Upgrade the Computer Vision Model:** Consider using more powerful and specialized models for detection, such as **EfficientDet** or transformer-based networks, which could provide better performance in terms of accuracy without sacrificing speed.

3. **Utilize Advanced Hardware:** Using more powerful GPUs will allow processing images at higher resolutions and speeds. Investing in higher-quality cameras for capturing more details in images would also further improve detection accuracy.

4. **Enhance Image Quality:** Focus on optimizing both the quality of the images used in training and the images captured during the model's execution. Higher-quality, clearer images ensure that the model detects threats more accurately.

These improvements are essential steps to make the system more effective and flexible, enabling it to be used in various situations and across different beehives.

## Conclusion
*Hive Defender* was developed to provide a practical and efficient solution for monitoring the health of bees using computer vision and artificial intelligence technologies. By identifying and alerting the presence of threats such as *Varroa destructor*, the system can help preserve the integrity of beehives, which are crucial for pollination and environmental balance.

This project also served as a learning platform to deepen knowledge in AI and computer vision applied to environmental preservation. In the future, *Hive Defender* can be expanded to include the detection of other threats and factors affecting the well-being of bees, further contributing to the protection of these vital insects.
